# Romanian neighbors
***

### Circuit
***
- Use a potentiometer and an Arduino board + jumpers;    
- Connect potentiometer extremities to GND and Vcc; the output to A0;   
- Copy the code into an Arduino sketch.   
***
### Purpose
***
- Use structs;   
- "Have at least one Arduino projects per week :)";    
- Improve my programming skills.   
***
### How it works?
***
- If you already copied the code and have the circuit ready, now you can play with the potentiometer; open the Serial Monitor (use 9600 baud), and after each 5s, it will apear the current value of the potentiometer together with its equivalent neighbor of Romanian...
- The project is not very well designed, but the purpose has been achieved.
