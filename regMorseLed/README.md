# Morse code - led blinking
***

### Circuit
***
- Arduino board; 1 potentiometer; 1 led; wires...     
- Connect the potentiometer output to A0 (analog pin 0 in Arduino; don't forget GNG to GND and VCC/+ to 5V); led + to D2 (digital pin 2 in Arduino; don't forget to put a resistance to led - pin, I have a resistance of 1K);      
- Copy the code into your Arduino sketch.    

### Purpose
***
- Learn new things;   
- Improve electronic/programming skills;   
- Implement Morse code into an electronic project;
- Make something useful.
